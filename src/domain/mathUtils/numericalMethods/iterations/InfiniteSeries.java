/**
 * This class provides a framework to compute an infinite series. 
 * <p>Computation of a series is performed by adding sequentially term by term.</p>
 * <p>When the series term has a lower value than the desired precision, then the computation should finish.
 * Thus the series computation can follow a general iterative process
 * <p>Each subclass should be able to retrieve specific elements of the series by implementing the abstract methods.
 * <p>A series is a function. Therefore the subclasses of this framework should implement the {@link OneVariableFunction} interface
